Competencies

Our applications need persistent data to function properly. 
Databases are built to efficiently store lots of data independent of your programs, they exist on their own, but we will also be connecting them to our applications 
One of the most common database languages is SQL, and a simple framework is SQLite
Databases can be visually imagined like an excel spreadsheet with tables
We communicate with the database through queries or commands through the console or even directly in our code


Applications
Understand databases and create a simple one
Be familiar with SQL queries in the command line
